Recap :

Output statements: console.log()
This is a prebuilt method used to output some data, text to console for debugging purposes.

Debuggin: Trouble -shooting the program to find issues, logic errors etc

Escape Sequances:
\'
\"
\\
\n insert a new line
\t insert a tab Space

With ES6, JS added with backticks which provides Template Literals
These backticks allows us to insert any special characters in out text including tab space or new line

`    Hello,

Today is a beatiful way!`

variables: Special containers used to store data and these variables can be accessed later in your program

var-let-const are used to declare or inititalize variables in JS and These

Syntax: Initialization 
var variableName = value;
let varName = value;
const varName = value;

Declaration:
var variableName; //undefined
let varName; //undefined

Assignment:
varName = value;

Re-assignment:
varName = value;

Variable Naming Rules and Conventions:
Rule: is syntax and we have to follow
Convention: not a rule and will not break the program if you do not follow but it is highly recommended and followed by programmers

RULES:
- You can not start variable with a digit
- No special characters allowed except _ (underscore), $, and other currency strings
- No space
- You can not use a variable name twice in the same file and in the same scope
- You cannot use reserved keywords: var,let,const,function, class, static, finally, abstract

Convention:
-Variable name should always be meaningful
-camelCase rule is followed for variables which my have a few word in it numberOfStudentsInBatch10
-Variable names are usually (99%) starts with lowercase letters
-SSN, ZIP, dateOfBirth, DOB , dob,TIN, VIN, MTN , mobileTelephoneNumber
-We do not prefere too long variable names

DATA TYPES:

Primitive Types: basic types that usually stores a piece of information
7 primitives:
String: text
Number: number
BigInt: big number
boolean: true or false
undefined: 
null:
symbol:

Reference Types: 
arrays, objects, maps


1. String: a sequence of characters (zero, one, or multiple characters)
We store strings in single or double quotes
let name = 'John';
let city = "Chicago";

1. String: a sequence of characters ( zero or multipe characters)

'' - empty string
' ' - string
'123' - string

2. Number : in JS is used to store all absolute and decimal numbers (8 bytes)

Whole numbers - absolute numbers: 1,2,3,4,500,10000
Decimal numbers - floating numbers: 2.5, 10.99, 1.34897

byte: -128,127
short: 2 bytes
int: 4 bytes
long: 8 bytes

float: 4 bytes up to 15-16 precision
double: 

3. BigInt: used to store larger numbers (more than 8 bytes)





= vs == vs ===
= assignment 
== comparison (loose)
=== somparison operator (strict)

3==3 true
3 == '3' false
3 === '3' false === checks data type and variable

Undefined vs null
undefined is the default type when you declare a variable but do not provide any value.
Null is specially stating that this variable holds no value. Absence of information

typeOf undefined will return undefined
typeOf null will return object

let laptopModel;

Object data type is used to store key-value pairs, properties
firstName = 'John';
lastName = 'Doe';
age = 25;
phoneNumber = '000-000-0000';
email = 'johndoe@gmail.com';
password = 'john1234'
