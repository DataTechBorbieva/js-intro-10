VARIABLES:
- it is a special container that stores a value
- you can change the initial value


var-let-Comments
Before 2015(ES6)
-there was only VAR keyboard used for VARIABLES
- You can re-assign values to var VARIABLES

After 2015(ES6)
- JS introduced 2 new keywords: let and const to be used instead of var keyword
- let can be re-assigned with a new value
-const it used for constants and cannot be re-assigned

-let can be declared and assigned a value later
-let variable value is going to be undefined if its declared but not assigned with any value
-const cannot be decalred without a value and MUST always be initialized with an initial value

Data Types:
string : text data type which can be stored in VARIABLES using single or double quotes
number : is number data which can be stored in variables without quotes

Concatenation: combining multiple strings together using + operator 

'5' + 3 = '53'
'5' + 3 + 2 = '532'
'5' + (3 + 2) = '55'
2 + 1 + '0' = '30'

Variable Naming: how we should name our variables?

Convention: its not a written rule but followed by all the coders/programmers
